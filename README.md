==========================

Coptex Project concept is building a Helicopter Capable of full understanding of it's physical environment and adapt in a Dynamic way to ensure full space position control and displace in an efficient manner within it's surroundings.

'Scorpion Copter' Is the name of the main device, Running an AI Engine for Human Interaction, Route Planning, Collision-Avoidance (ACRP: Anti-Collision Route Planner)

Coptex Project it's been developped over a Cutting-Edge Platform (Samsung's exynos5422 SoC) with a fairy complex Multicore Processing, Embedding 4 Cortex A7 Processors for System Static Load and 4 Cortex A15 for System Real-Time Artificial Intelligence tasks, Mali-T628 GPU for GPGPU-Programming model with OpenCL.

*Scorpion Copter Will be equipped with 2 HD Cameras to provice stereo-vision and Power a Telemetry Engine.
*In the mechanical part, It will probably be printed in Titanium and/or Carbon Nanotubes Structures.
*High Speed Networking Capabilities WiFi (802.11b/g; 25Mbps), GSM, 3G (7.2Mbps) Interface.
*Ecryted Security Protocols (SSL, SELinux).
*In Case of Emergency Protocols, Restore a Secure Shell If Connection gets Compromised.
*Dynamic Magnetic Suspension
*Full Inertial-Spatial-Pose Control
*Worst-Case Scenario Recovering System

Actual Stage is From Planning to First Prototype

Best Regards!
