 * Description:
 *
 * The BMP085 is a new generation of high precision digital pressure sensors
 * for consumer applications. The BMP085 is based on piezo-resistive technology
 * for EMC robustness, high accuracy and linearity as well as long term stability.
 * The ultra-low power, low voltage electronics of the BMP085 is optimized for
 * use in mobile phones, PDAs, GPS navigation devices and outdoor equipment. With
 * a low altitude noise of merely 0.25m at fast conversion time, the BMP085 offers
 * superior performance. The I2C interface allows for easy system integration with
 * a microcontroller.
